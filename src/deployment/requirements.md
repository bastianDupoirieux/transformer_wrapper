# Ray Wrapper Requirements

## Goal: Simplified deployment and usage of models running on pre- or user-defined compute, query the model directly via an app

## Core Deployment Features
- [ ] Dynamically scale allocated resources up or down depending on cluster usage (autoscale up or down depending on resources used)
- [ ] Differentiate between deployment for testing and deployment to production
- [ ] Assign unique ID to every deployment for generation of config file
- [ ] Allow users to deploy any model to a ray cluster by building serve config file automatically
- [ ] Allow users to set up ray cluster with desired resources and deploy their model
- [ ] Verify model was tested by requiring unit test before allowing production deployment
- [ ] Support automatic application updates even when running in production
- [ ] For production deployment, implement custom docker image creation and HTTP request best practices

## Model Management & Versioning
- [ ] Model registry integration (MLflow, DVC, HuggingFace Hub)
- [ ] Model versioning with rollback capabilities
- [ ] A/B testing support for multiple model versions
- [ ] Model performance monitoring (accuracy, latency, drift metrics)

## Configuration & Validation
- [ ] Model validation schemas for input/output formats
- [ ] Health checks for automatic model validation before deployment
- [ ] Configuration validation for resource requirements and dependencies
- [ ] Environment-specific configurations (dev/staging/prod)

## Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Built-in metrics (request latency, throughput, error rates)
- [ ] Logging integration with structured logging and correlation IDs
- [ ] Distributed tracing for request flows
- [ ] Alerting for model failures or performance degradation

## Security & Access Control
- [ ] Authentication/Authorization (API keys, JWT tokens, OAuth)
- [ ] Rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair resource usage
- [ ] Input sanitization to protect against malicious inputs
- [ ] Model encryption for secure model weights in transit and at rest

## Developer Experience
- [ ] CLI tool for easy deployment commands
- [ ] Pre-built templates for common model types (classification, regression, etc.)
- [ ] Hot reloading for model updates without full redeployment
- [ ] Local development mode with same interface as production

## Advanced Scaling
- [ ] Predictive scaling based on historical usage patterns
- [ ] Custom scaling policies with user-defined scaling rules
- [ ] Multi-region deployment across different geographic regions
- [ ] Intelligent load balancing and request routing

## Testing & Quality Assurance
- [ ] Integration test framework for automated testing of deployed models
- [ ] Performance benchmarking to compare model performance across versions
- [ ] Stress testing to validate model behavior under high load
- [ ] Regression testing to ensure new versions don't break existing functionality

## Data Pipeline Integration
- [ ] Batch processing for large datasets
- [ ] Streaming support for real-time model inference
- [ ] Data validation to ensure input data quality
- [ ] Feature store integration for consistent features

## Cost Optimization
- [ ] Resource usage analytics to track and optimize compute costs
- [ ] Auto-shutdown for unused deployments to save costs
- [ ] Spot instance support for cheaper cloud instances
- [ ] Cost alerts when spending exceeds thresholds

## Documentation & Support
- [ ] Auto-generated API docs (Swagger/OpenAPI)
- [ ] Model cards for standardized model documentation
- [ ] Usage examples with code snippets for common use cases
- [ ] Troubleshooting guides for common issues and solutions
